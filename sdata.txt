multimedia applications
, such as Internet phone,
 real-time video conferencing,
 and streaming of stored audio
 and video. We just mention now
 that all of these applica-
tions can tolerate a small 
amount of packet loss, 
so that reliable data
 transfer is not
absolutely critical
 for the application’s
 success. Furthermore,
 real-time applications,
like Internet phone and
 video conferencing, 
react very poorly to
 TCP’s congestion
control. For these
 reasons, developers
 of multimedia applications
 may choose to run
their applications over UD
P instead of TCP. When packet 
loss rates are low, and
